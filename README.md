# üß™ Software Testing Portfolio

Welcome to my testing portfolio!  
Here you can find examples of my manual testing work, including test cases and bug reports created during my QA training and self-study projects.

## üë©‚Äçüíª About Me

Hi, I'm Jana ‚Äì an aspiring Software Tester with a passion for quality and detail. Since early 2024, I‚Äôve been actively studying and practicing manual testing techniques, focusing on detecting bugs, ensuring functionality, and supporting high-quality software releases.

I'm a detail-oriented and analytical thinker, known for being reliable, responsible, and well-organized. I enjoy working in collaborative environments where clear communication and teamwork are key.

I have a solid foundation in manual testing and am continuously building my skills in automation tools like Cypress and Selenium, as well as in technologies such as SQL, HTML/CSS, and Java basics.

Currently, I'm working on hands-on testing projects and expanding my knowledge through various QA and automation courses.
